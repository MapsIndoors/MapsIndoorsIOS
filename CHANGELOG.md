## [3.21.0] 2021-03-16

### Changed

- A map label will now be centered when the icon is hidden for a given Location.
- When Live Data is enabled for both `occupancy` and `availability`, the default rendering will now combine these two into a visualisation where it is possible to see if a room is booked and how many people are in the room.

## [3.20.0] 2021-03-05

### Changed

- Changed the default map label font to Arial to fix a rendering issue with the original default font. The choice of Arial font aligns well with rendering on a Google Map. If you need to change this, use `MPMapControl.mapLabelFont`
- Changed the default map label font size to 14 points.
- `MPMapControlDelegate` method `didTapAtCoordinate(withLocations:)` now calls back on both map and marker tappings.

### Fixed

- Fixed some map label rendering artifacts when rendering the system font with a stroke as the map label font.
- Fixed some Live Data related stability issues.
- Fixed a caching issue causing some Locations to get the same icon.

## [3.19.0] 2021-02-24

### Changed

- `MPLocationService` now accounts for vertical proximity when `near` (z value) parameter is provided with `MPQuery`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a map rendering issue where icons would appear/disappear in a flaky and not intuitive manner.
- Fixed an issue with custom Display Rules not being properly rendered.
- Fixed an issue in the Live Data convenience methods in `MPMapControl`, causing Live Data subscriptions not to be updated a Floor level change.
- Fixed an issue causing the default Live Data rendering to skip Locations that were previously not shown.

## [3.18.0] 2021-02-05

### Added

- Added a `floorName` property on `MPLocation`.

### Changed

- Changed the default icon for a Location where it is not possible to determine a specific icon.
- Changed `iconUrl` on `MPLocation` so that it will conveniently return either specific icon url or the icon url for the corresponding Location Type.

## [3.17.0] 2021-01-21

### Added

- Added an `address` property on `MPBuilding` which can be set in MapsIndoors CMS.

### Fixed

- Fixed a date bug in the `MPBookingService` causing the service to query for available Locations with a wrong date, offset by one hour from the intended date.
- Fixed a bug preventing display of info windows for Locations that should not have an icon nor a label.
- Improved various elements of our search engine.

### Changed

- Changed the default selection highlight color for Locations with a polygon shape. See [more about the UX decision behind it here](https://blog.mapspeople.com/new-selection-highlight-color). To customize the highlight color see this [guide about map styling](https://docs.mapsindoors.com/ios/v3/map-styling/#modify-the-display-rule-for-the-selected-location).

## [3.16.1] 2021-01-04

### Added

- Added convenience methods for enabling Live Data for a `MPMapControl` instance. Methods are `MPMapControl.enableLiveData()` (two variants) and `MPMapControl.disableLiveData()`. For more information, read about this feature in the [Live Data Guide](https://docs.mapsindoors.com/ios/v3/live-data/).
- Added default rendering of Live Data when using the above interface.
- Added optional method `updateLiveDataInfo` to `MPLiveDataManager`. This makes it possible to fetch updated information about active Live Data Domain Types in the current dataset.
- Added optional method `didUpdateLiveDataInfo` to `MPLiveDataManagerDelegate`. This makes it possible to receive updated information about active Live Data Domain Types in the current dataset.
- When developing with Live Data, you can now use/cast to subclasses of `MPLiveUpdate`: `MPPositionLiveUpdate`, `MPOccupancyLiveUpdate`, `MPAvailabilityLiveUpdate`.
- Added `types` and `locations` filter to `MPLocationService`.
- Now returning an error from `MPLocationService` if a Location Source status changes to `unavailable`.
- Added property `positionProviderConfigs` on `MPSolution` model.
- Added property `dataSetId` on `MPSolution` model.
- Added property `isIndoors` on `MPLocation` model, returning true if location is indoors and belongs to a building.

### Changed

- Made `didReceiveLiveUpdate` on `MPLiveDataManagerDelegate` optional.
- Deprecated `MPLocationsProvider`. You can/should use `MPLocationService` instead.
- Instead of ignoring Topics with Domain Types that are not relevant/active for current dataset, `MPLiveDataManager` will now throw an error through the delegate instead.

### Fixed

- Fix `bbox` getter returning `nil` on `MPMultiPolygonGeometry` and `MPPolygonGeometry`
- Fixed occasional crash in `MPBooking` deserialization.
- Improved search and filtering quality of the search engine in `MPLocationService`.

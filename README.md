# MapsIndoors

This repository is for v3 of MapsIndoors for which support ended as of September 2024.

You should update to MapsIndoors v4, which can be found at https://github.com/MapsPeople/MapsIndoors-SDK-iOS

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

### Known Issues

> 1. Developing on the new Arm-based Apple Silicon (M1) Macs requires building and running on a physical iOS device or using an iOS simulator running iOS 13.7, e.g. iPhone 11. This is a temporary limitation in Google Maps SDK for iOS, and as such also a limitation in MapsIndoors, due to the dependency to Google Maps.

## Installation

MapsIndoors is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "MapsIndoors"
```
